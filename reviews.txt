Review: This is a great place to stay for peace and quiet. If you want to get away and be closer to the lake this is a good choice. Denis is incredibly engaged and responsive if you need anything.

Review: It’s an immaculate quiet place. It’s very clean and modernized house. It’s a safe neighborhood (a good distance with the next neighbor l). It’s a good place to stay if you want to explore Westcliff Beach or Park (5 mins behind the Westcliff park), Miller Spring Park (9 mins), Chalk Ridge Falls (18 mins) and Summit Soccer Complex (17 mins) and other more rivers and lake around. They have a welcome bottle of water and snacks. They have coffee filter and coffee maker (bring your own coffee), Swiss chocolate, sugar, salt, pepper, and cooking oil although we brought our own. They have all the cooking pans you need. Their 2 full bathroom has soap and shampoos/ conditioners. If you’re a woman who needs magnifying mirror for make up, please bring your own. Overall, the host is very proactive and responds a lot to your questions.
